This pawn is already supported by the white square bishop, thanks to E3, and again tries to control the centre.";

So why do I play it?<br><br> I use this opening mainly because of it's potential to move the B pawn up to the 5th, and have it defended by the white bishop, within three moves. This works especially well if Black moved his Knight to C6 on their second turn as shown.";

Bobby Fischer, Magnus Carlsen and Gary Kasparov to name just a few. <br><br> Opening by moving the C pawn to C4, the English usually lends itself to a solid opening that can adapt to whatever Black throws at it.<br><br> Whilst it may look quite similar to Bird's opening, albeit on the left side of the board, you have to remember that the Queen happens to be on the left side of the board as well, making it easier to develop her more quickly.";
